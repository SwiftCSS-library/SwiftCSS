## 💡 Usage

VegaCSS is based on a utility class system. Here's a quick example of how to style a card:

```html
<div class="s-card s-shadow-lg s-p-6 s-rounded-xl s-bg-white">
    <h3 class="s-text-2xl s-font-bold s-mb-4 s-text-primary">Card Title</h3>
    <p class="s-text-gray-700 s-mb-6">
        This is a sample card created using VegaCSS utility classes.
        Simple, elegant, and responsive!
    </p>
    <button class="s-btn s-btn-primary s-rounded-full s-py-3 s-px-8">
        Learn More
    </button>
</div>

<button class="s-btn s-btn-secondary s-rounded-md s-mt-4">
    Cancel
</button>
```

These classes (e.g., `s-card`, `s-shadow-lg`, `s-p-6`, `s-text-primary`, `s-btn`) provide predefined, composable styles that you can combine to create any kind of layout or component.

For a complete guide on all available classes and customization options, check out our [full documentation](http://node1.zampto.net:25604/docs.html).
